ros-melodic-rwth-upper-body-detector (1.0.11-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Adapt stability fixes to upper-body detector + config changes from LCAS (provided by Manuel in pull request #59 <https://github.com/spencer-project/spencer_people_tracking/issues/59>, commit e5ca86b28c99) to the SPENCER version.
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/MFernandezCarmona/spencer_people_tracking into master
  * Merge pull request #52 <https://github.com/spencer-project/spencer_people_tracking/issues/52> from Sangheli/patch-1
    In upper-body detector, use correct dimensions of depth image (important when not using VGA resolution; otherwise part of image might not be used for detection)
  * Fixed depth image converting to matrix when resolution!=640x480

ros-melodic-rwth-upper-body-detector (1.0.1-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * homogenised all version strings to 1.0.0
  * various install targets added that were missing
  * Fix crash on startup of upper_body_detector
    If the upper_body_detector is initialized before the rgbd sensor and the
    depth image is received before the rgb image (as is the case with a
    kinect v1 using openni1 driver), color_image is an empty smart pointer
    and thus trying to access a member causes a segfault.
  * check for if position is out of range
  * Remap upper-body detector topics correctly for tracking_single_rgbd_sensor.launch to work with OpenNi1, #20 <https://github.com/LCAS/spencer_people_tracking/issues/20>
  * Fix license of upper-body detector
  * Fix license of upper-body detector
  * adjusted KConnectedComponentLabeler to drop depency to CPoint (due to license issues)
  * In upper_body_detector, ensure that input depth image has proper encoding
  * Minor optimization in upper_body_detector visualization
    Instead of using synchronizer for color and depth image, only subscribe to color image if visualization is enabled. This also reduces network traffic and RGB-D driver CPU load. Color image is not used by detector itself.
  * Synching topic names with internal repo, changes from integration week III
  * Update README.md
  * Update package.xml
  * Adding upper-body and groundHOG detectors
